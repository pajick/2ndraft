                        Older residents tell us that Clane was regularly flooded by the river
                        Liffey prior to the building of the Poulaphuca Dam in 1941. The
                        floodwaters came up to the cottages on the Naas road, drowning pigs
                        which were housed in the back gardens and extended across the Church
                        parks towards the Boys'school and into back yards along the Main Street.
                        Looking back into medieval times and earlier, it is not difficult to
                        imagine that in time of extra bad flooding, such as might have occurred
                        perhaps only a few times a century, that only three or four areas of the
                        village might have stood high enough to escape the flooding. These are
                        the Village Green - crowned by the old graveyard and church ruins; the
                        Main Street which slopes steeply into the yards of the premises which
                        line it on both sides, causing it to resemble an up-turned boat; the
                        elevated centre of the convent field opposite Liffey Lawns; the site of
                        Clane Hall - known traditionally as Coiseanna Hill and probably meaning
                        'beside the marsh', and lastly, the site of the Franciscan Priory and
                        Abbey Cemetery, which is on a slightly elevated site compare to the
                        surrounding fields. Even to the present, the Naas Road occasionally
                        floods when the stream overflows its banks below the new Park, while in
                        the late fifties, the townsland of Capdoo Commons flooded up from the
                        Liffey following a very wet November, and for a few days the Dublin Road
                        ran through a sea of water extending to both left and right and running
                        for some hundreds of yards eastwards from the village. The road itself
                        remained only just above the level of the flood because of the foresight
                        of the eighteenth century engineers in building it so high above the
                        field level through the stretch in question. It would appear therefore
                        that areas permanently unaffected by flooding might well have been at a
                        premium. This, and the fact that Clane has been an important area of
                        settlement, at least from early Christian times, must singleout these
                        areas as being of great importance in understanding this settlementand
                        how it developed. If one is to believe the mythology and the early
                        recorded tradition, Clane had an importance going back to pagan times.</div><a class="bdy"

                    <div id="hill">The Round Hill of Clane</div>
                    <div class="first"> In the Annals of MacFirbish, it is
                        recorded before going into battle, the Leinstermen traditionally
                        assembled on the Crocaun Claonta, translated as 'The Round Hill of
                        Clane'. Their belief was that in so doing they could only meet with
                        success. Where this hill was is anybody's guess. There are two areas in
                        Clane bearing the name 'Crocaun'; one a townsland on the Prosperous
                        Road, which, incongruously, is completely flat; the other is the hill
                        where Peter McCreeery's training stables were situated - supporting
                        evidence, you might say. The Fair Green hill itself must be regarded as
                        a distinct possibility, and perhaps Coiseanna Hill. Other pagan
                        connections are seen in the Bullan Stone on the banks of the stream
                        opposite the entrance to Abbeylands, supposed to be connected with
                        Druidic sacrifices, and the supposed burial mounds at Clane and Mainham,
                        reputed to be the resting places of Mesgegra - first century King of
                        Leinster, and his wife Buan, after the depredation caused by the fierce
                        Conal Cearnach, Champion of Ulster. The account is in the "Forbais
                        Eadair" (the Siege of Howth), an ancient historic tale. Back to top St.
                        Ailbe Whatever its earlier origins, the future of Clane as a settlement
                        was determined when St. Ailbe of Emily built a monastery here in the
                        early part of the sixth century. This monastery was probably demolished
                        when the Franciscans (Norman's) built their establishment here in 1258.
                        Throughout its long history, very little is recorded of the Celtic
                        Monastery, apart from the fact that it was plundered by the Danes in
                        1035, but the raiders were overtaken and slaughtered by Donnochadh, son
                        of Domhnall. No doubt the settlement had an entirely different shape in
                        those days. The broad main street with its well aligned business and
                        residential premises bears the stamp of 18th century town planning and
                        was already in existence on a map of 1752.

                    <div class="first"> In early monastic
                        settlements, we are told that there was no distinction between the
                        religious and secular life and the local community, which would have had
                        a clan structure, all lived together and prayed together and worked the
                        soil, which under the Irish system, was held in common. The community
                        would probably have been housed in round thatched huts of wattle and
                        daub. One would have expected that a monastery like that of Clane would
                        have left us a stone church in the Hiberno-romanesque style, with
                        perhaps a round tower like that of Teachdoo or Kildare; sadly none
                        remains. Certainly the monastery at Clane was large and important, if we
                        are only to judge by the fact that that a General Synod of the church in
                        Ireland was held here in 1162, seven years before the coming of the
                        Normans, and was attended by St. Laurence O'Toole of Dublin and Gelassus
                        of Armagh, together with many abbots. The business of the Synod was that
                        no one should practice as a lecturer in theology who not been trained at
                        Armagh, a decision which further confirmed the newly established Primacy
                        of Armagh. </div>

                    <div id="site">The site of the monastery</div>
                    <div class="first"> Where was this
                        monastery situated? As pointed out earlier, there were only a few
                        possibilities. The Green, which is the most elevated site and which has a
                        tradition of Christian burial. A church ruins of the Post Reformation
                        must indeed be the most likely site if it were not so limited in area. A
                        number of years ago, a superficial examination was made to see if the
                        convent field, to the rear of Dillon's, might not have provide an
                        extension of this site. There seemed to be some indication of this.
                        During the last two years, the field has been meadowed for the first
                        time in living memory, and some very interesting phenomena have come to
                        light. On each occasion, the elevated portion of the field developed an
                        extensive pattern of circles of much darker grass in the after grass.
                        There were ten complete circles with diameters of between five and ten
                        metres. There were also some semi-circles and larger curves. An, as yet,
                        slight investigation of the soil beneath showed that whereas the field
                        as a whole has an extraordinarily dark, soft, peaty loam, the soil is
                        remarkably different under the circles, being distinctly gray and more
                        gritty. This year, an opportunity was taken to map the field at a scale
                        of 1:100 before the contrast had faded. There would seem to be strong
                        indications of ancient habitation and a more professional examination
                        would seem to be appropriate. This is not the only point of interest
                        attaching to this particular field.</div><a class="bdy"

                    <div id="newtown"> Newtown of Clane</div>
                    <div class="first"> It is
                        marked on the map of 1752 as 'Maudlin Newtown'. The word 'Maudlin, where
                        it occurs in place names is reputed to relate to Magdalen, and is
                        regarded as indicating a hospital or refuge for wayfarers or vagabonds,
                        such as would have been run by monks. In the confiscation of the
                        Franciscan lands, a field of four acres is listed 'in the Newtown of
                        Clane'. A connection with the Norman Franciscans could well imply an
                        earlier connection with the earlier Celtic Monastery. Even the later
                        history is of interest in that it was part of the glebe lands of the
                        Protestant Church which Archdeacon Sherlock referred to as 'Economy
                        Lands' and claimed that they were the remnants which were close to the
                        village and held in common by the Portreeves and Commons of Clane, and
                        later set out annually by the Vestry - strictly to residents of Clane.
                        Such lands were often sub-divided by marker stones, not hedges. There
                        were about twelve granite stones about the field with conical tops and
                        rectangular bases set about eighteen inches in the ground. Mr. Ned Ennis
                        confirms that the land was set out from stone to stone according to a
                        tradition which he received from his late father. Unfortunately the
                        stones vanished only this summer. Similar stones turned up in the last
                        few years at the wall at Woods' bank on the Kilcock Road and also in
                        Clane townsland, south of the 'Orchard' in Loughbollard. Lastly, the
                        same convent field is also the site of an old well, known as 'Fr.
                        Batty's Well', reputed to hold a cure for toothache. It is no
                        exaggeration to say we are walking on history.</div>
