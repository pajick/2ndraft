        There has been a church on the green in Clane since 520 AD when St.
        Ailbe, Bishop of Ferns, established an abbey in Clane. He made St.
        Sencel, the elder, its first abbot. It was here that the famous synod
        of 1162 was held. In 1542 the Monastery was disbanded. A reference in
        the Royal Visitation Book describes the chancel as being in ruins in
        1615. <p>Petit's map of the Down Survey conducted in the latter half of
          that century shows two churches on the site.</p>
        <p class="break">
          The Church of Ireland maintained continuity of worship there until
          1883 when the church of St. Michael and the angels was built in
          Millicent.

          Taylor's map of 1783 shows a thumbsketch of the church with,
          surprisingly, a tall pointed spire surmounting the present square
          steeple.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1798 at least part of the church(probably the roof) was destroyed
          by fire and the economy lands had to be mortgaged to raise funds for
          restoring it and for building a spire to the steeple.

          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The building of the spire seems to have been skimped, for as soon
          afterwards as 1826, the consent of the Bishop was obtained to have it
          taken down in consequence of its very unsafe state and the "repeated
          expenses incurred by it".
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposal, however, aroused the wrath of the people who assembled
          in large numbers and resolved "that every expedient be tried before
          the parishioners resort to the necessity of taking down the village
          spire". Three surveyors were appointed to report on the state of the
          spire, but it was ultimately taken down and in the words of the
          Vestry: "The steeple was surmounted by pinnacles" which may still be
          seen - minus their points.</p>
