            <h3>ORDNANCE SURVEY</h3>
            <p>
                In the 1830’s the Ordnance Survey in Ireland produced 6-inch-scale maps of the entire island, in
                anticipation of Griffith’s Valuation. In order to prepare these maps, an army of surveyors was sent out
                in
                advance to collect town and area names and try to standardise the spelling of place names in Ireland
                (based
                primarily on whichever of the recorded spellings came closest to the Irish). Their notes are collected
                in
                Field Names Books, usually one per civil parish, which are preserved in the National Archives. These
                sometimes also contain notes on soils, farming practices, leases and rents, prominent buildings and
                ruins,
                the social condition of the people, and the most common surnames in the townslands. </p><br>

                Following are some
                excerpts from the parish of Clane field name book, completed in November 1837.</p><br>

                    residences are Fairmount House and Millicent House, the Demesnes of which are both kept in good
