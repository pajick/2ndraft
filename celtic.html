                In the Abbey cemetery on the road to Naas from Clane, just inside the ruins of the 13th century
                Franciscan
                Friary, stands a seven foot high stone cross in the Celtic mode. It is in a plain style but sharply
                executed and clearly inscribed. The quality, or even the fact that there is a stone, suggests a
                family
                of some
                means. The inscription reads as follows:-</p>

                    It appears that those who were active at a local level in the United Irishmen in 1798 and the
                    years
                    which led
                    up
                    to it continued to be active up until 1802. Michael Doorly was drilling four or five hundred men
                    at
                    Lullymore
                    up
                    to that year. Matthew Donnellan was a farmer from Clane and, with Doorly, drilled a contingent
                    of
                    Clane men at
                    Lullymore a couple of nights a week. There were also contingents from Carlow and Offaly.
                    Donnellan
                    is said to
                    have walked over and back from Clane to Lullymore(17.5kms).<sub>(1)</sub>

                An earlier reference in the DUBLIN EVENING POST announced that on the 16th February 1798 a charity
                ball
                would be
                held at the County Kildare Merry Harrier Clubroom, Clane, under the patronage of Mrs. Bundette, Mrs.
                Fitzgerald,
                Mrs. Wolfe, Mrs. Esmond, Mrs. Griffith, Mrs. Browne and Mrs. Alymer who would provide supper.
                Subscriptions were
                distributed among the poor of the parishes inhabited by the patronesses. Tickets: gentlemen 11/4;
                ladies
                5/5,
                from
                the patronesses or from Mr. Matthew Donnellan, Clane. <sub>(2)</sub> </div>

                Thomas Donnellan, presumably the son, is listed in the Valuation Survey of 1850 as occupier of four
                holdings
                with
                a total of 106 acres in Ballynaboley and 33 acres in Clane townsland. In addition, he himself was a
                lessor of
                seventeen properties, including 16 houses in the village, with 10 yards, 2 out-offices and 6
                gardens.

                When Theobald Wolfe Tone emigrated to America following the Jackson affair in 1796, he leased his
                house
                in
                Bodenstown to one Matthew Donnellan.</div>
