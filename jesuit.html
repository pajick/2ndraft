          The Jesuit plot in Clongowes Wood College is the final resting place
          of several eminent members of the Society of Jesus, who were
          associated with the college and the parish of Clane. The remains of
          the early Fathers at Clongowes were transfered from the graveyard of
          Mainham to the Jesuit plot in 1866 and are marked by a handsome
          Celtic cross at the head of the main path. They include:

              Fr. Claudius Gautard came to Ireland before the restoration of
              the Order. Between 1798 and 1800 he officiated as chaplin to the
              religious of George's Hill Convent in Dublin. he lived in
              Clongowes Wood following its establishment in 1814 and died
              there on 25th October 1821.

              Fr. Caisimir Hlasko, born in Poland in 1782, was a professor of
              natural philosophy and dogmatic theology and reached Dublin in
              1820. He taught in Clongowes, where he died on 27th January
              1831, aged 49.

            In the best cosmopolitan tradition of the Order, the national
            culture stood only to benefit by exposure to the best of Europe.
            What might seem more of a surprise in its own way, is that the
            parish of Clane was well represented in this cultural milieu, in
            that no less than two very eminent Jesiut Fathers in the Clongowes
            community of the time were members of local families, a fact which
            may go a long way towards explaining the Jesuits' choice of Clane
            for the establishment of their first college in Ireland.
